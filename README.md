# libsm64-panda
(still super heavy WIP) Panda3D Python bindings for libsm64

## How?
Check out libsm64: https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64

## Running
You'll need to build libsm64 yourself - as well as have a copy of the Super Mario 64 US rom  
Put both (named "sm64" with respective file extensions) in the root project directory  
And to run this, open your favorite command line and run ``ppython main.py`` to run the example program .
